Learned how to manipulate files and folders in terminal in various ways

Here are some commands I learned:

echo - prints text, "text" >> "filename" writes text to file
pwd - prints the working directory
cp - copy file or folder, -r flag copies all contents
rm - remove file or folder, -r flag removes all contents
mv - mv/rename file or folder
clear - removes text from terminal
mkdir - makes a directory
rmdir - removes a directory, -r flag removes all contents
--help - returns flags for command
cd - changes to directory, .. up a directory which can be chained (../../..)
ls - list directory contents, -l long list
find - returns tree of directory, -name can specify what's being searched for
